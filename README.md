# Metastasis-Tracker-AI-
Develment of an AI tool to track hematic cancer metastasis

Map diameter of arteries.

Map percentage of arteries as a percentage of aorta.

Map speed of pycnogonida against blood flow.

Map speed of pycnogonida with blood flow.

Start point = infection enters artery.

Speed/distance = location over time.

If pycnogonida > diameter of arterial branch, Then Tumor exists (lodges and grows)

Measure probability of branch route by largest diameter, factor target proteins from organs, lymphs.

Increment organs to determine tumor locations.

Increment lymph arterial flow to determine lymphoma locations.

Increment bone arterial flow to determine bone cancer infection locations.
